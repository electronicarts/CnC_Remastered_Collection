 *---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 *                                                                         						  *
 * These routines establish & maintain peer-to-peer connections between this system				  *
 * and all others in the game.  Each system finds out the IPX address of the others,			  *
 * and forms a direct connection (IPXConnectionClass) to that system.  Systems are				  *
 * found out via broadcast queries.  Every system broadcasts its queries, and every				  *
 * system replies to queries it receives.  At the point when the game owner signals				  *
 * 'OK', every system must know about all the other systems in the game.							  *
 *                                                                         						  *
 * How Bridges are handled:																						  *
 * Currently, bridges are handled by specifying the destination IPX address of the				  *
 * "server" (game owner's system) on the command-line.  This address is used to					  *
 * derive a broadcast address to that destination network, and this system's queries			  *
 * are broadcast over its network & the server's network; replies to the queries come			  *
 * with each system's IPX address attached, so once we have the address, we can form			  *
 * a connection with any system on the bridged net.														  *
 *                                                                         						  *
 * The flaw in this plan is that we can only cross one bridge.  If there are 3 nets				  *
 * bridged (A, B, & C), and the server is on net B, and we're on net A, our broadcasts			  *
 * will reach nets A & B, but not C.  The way to circumvent this (if it becomes a problem)	  *
 * would be to have the server tell us what other systems are in its game, not each				  *
 * individual player's system.  Thus, each system would find out about all the other systems	  *
 * by interacting with the game's owner system (this would be more involved than what			  *
 * I'm doing here).																									  *
 *                                                                         						  *

/***********************************************************************************************
 * Net_Join_Dialog -- lets user join an existing game or start a new one                       *
 *                                                                                             *
 * This dialog displays an edit field for the player's name, and a list of all non-stealth-    *
 * mode games.  Clicking once on a game name displays a list of who's in that game.  Clicking  *
 * "New" takes the user to the Net_New dialog, where he waits for other users to join his      *
 * game.  All other input is done through this dialog.                                         *
 *                                                                                             *
 * The dialog has several "states":                                                            *
 *                                                                                             *
 *   1) Initially, it waits for the user to fill in his/her name and then to select Join or    *
 *      New; if New is selected, this dialog is exited.                                        *
 *                                                                                             *
 *   2) If Join is selected, the Join & New buttons are removed, but the Cancel button remains.*
 *      The join request is transmitted to the game's owner, and the message "Waiting for      *
 *      Confirmation" is displayed, until a confirmation or denial is received from the game's *
 *      owner.  The user may click Cancel at this point to cancel the join request.            *
 *      (Once Join is selected, the name editing field is disabled, and becomes a display-only *
 *      field.  If cancel is selected, it reappears as an edit field.) The user can still click*
 *      around & see who's in which games.                                                     *
 *                                                                                             *
 *   3) If the join request is denied, the dialog re-initializes to its pre-join state; the    *
 *      Join & New buttons reappear, & the Name field is available again.                      *
 *                                                                                             *
 *   4) If join confirmation is obtained, the message changes to show all the current game	  *
 *      settings.  The user cannot click around & look at other games any more.					  *
 *                                                                                             *
 * Any game running in Stealth mode won't show up on this dialog.                              *
 *                                                                                             *
 * The 'Players' vector matches one-for-one the contents of the list box.  The local system	  *
 * is always listed first; the IPX Address of the local system will NOT be valid in the		  *
 * Players vector.  The Games & Players vectors should be left filled in even after this		  *
 * routine is exited; their contents are used to form connections to the other players,		  *
 * after the scenario has been loaded.																			  *
 *                                                                                             *
 * The 'Chat' vector contains the address of everyone who sends me a chat announcement.		  *
 * The address field is used to send everyone my outgoing messages.  The LastTime				  *
 * field is used as a timeout; if enough time goes by & we don't hear from this node,			  *
 * we ping him, requesting a CHAT_ANNOUNCE if he's still in chat.  If we don't hear				  *
 * from him after that, we remove him from our list.														  *

 * Net_Join_Dialog -- lets user join an existing game or start a new one                       *
 *                                                                                             *
 * This dialog displays an edit field for the player's name, and a list of all non-stealth-    *
 * mode games.  Clicking once on a game name displays a list of who's in that game.  Clicking  *
 * "New" takes the user to the Net_New dialog, where he waits for other users to join his      *
 * game.  All other input is done through this dialog.                                         *
 *                                                                                             *
 * The dialog has several "states":                                                            *
 *                                                                                             *
 *   1) Initially, it waits for the user to fill in his/her name and then to select Join or    *
 *      New; if New is selected, this dialog is exited.                                        *
 *                                                                                             *
 *   2) If Join is selected, the Join & New buttons are removed, but the Cancel button remains.*
 *      The join request is transmitted to the game's owner, and the message "Waiting for      *
 *      Confirmation" is displayed, until a confirmation or denial is received from the game's *
 *      owner.  The user may click Cancel at this point to cancel the join request.            *
 *      (Once Join is selected, the name editing field is disabled, and becomes a display-only *
 *      field.  If cancel is selected, it reappears as an edit field.) The user can still click*
 *      around & see who's in which games.                                                     *
 *                                                                                             *
 *   3) If the join request is denied, the dialog re-initializes to its pre-join state; the    *
 *      Join & New buttons reappear, & the Name field is available again.                      *
 *                                                                                             *
 *   4) If join confirmation is obtained, the message changes to show all the current game	  *
 *      settings.  The user cannot click around & look at other games any more.					  *
 *                                                                                             *

 * The 'Players' vector matches one-for-one the contents of the list box.  The local system	  *
 * is always listed first; the IPX Address of the local system will NOT be valid in the		  *
 * Players vector.  The Games & Players vectors should be left filled in even after this		  *
 * routine is exited; their contents are used to form connections to the other players,		  *
 * after the scenario has been loaded.																			  *

 * The 'Chat' vector contains the address of everyone who sends me a chat announcement.		  *
 * The address field is used to send everyone my outgoing messages.  The LastTime				  *
 * field is used as a timeout; if enough time goes by & we don't hear from this node,			  *
 * we ping him, requesting a CHAT_ANNOUNCE if he's still in chat.  If we don't hear				  *
 * from him after that, we remove him from our list.														  *
