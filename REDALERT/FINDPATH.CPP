 * The path algorithm works by following a LOS path to the target. If it                       *
 * collides with an impassable spot, it uses an Edge following routine to                      *
 * get around it. The edge follower moves along the edge in a clockwise or                     *
 * counter clockwise fashion until finding the destination spot. The                           *
 * destination is determined by Find_Path. It is the first passable that                       *
 * can be reached (so it will handle the doughnut case, where there is                         *
 * a passable in the center of an unreachable area).                                           *
